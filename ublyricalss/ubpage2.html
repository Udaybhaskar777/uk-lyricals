            Ram is a young graffiti artist who does not believe in everlasting love.  
            He has experienced nine relationships and believes that love eventually fades.  
            As someone with strong morals, he is honest and lives with an open heart and mind.  
            <br><br>
            Jaanu, his college mate, catches his eye, and he falls for her at first sight.  
            However, their ideologies clash when Jaanu wants a lifelong commitment,  
            while Ram believes true love cannot last forever.  
            She tries to convince him otherwise by showing examples of eternal love.
